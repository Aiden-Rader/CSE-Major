 * 
 * (Locate the largest element)
 * Write the following method that returns the location of 
 * the largest element in a two-dimensional array.
 * 
 * public static int[] locateLargest(double[][] a)
 * 
 * The return value is a one-dimensional array that contains two 
 * elements. These two elements indicate the row and column indices 
 * of the largest element in the two-dimensional array. 
 * If there are more than one largest element, return the 
 * smallest row index and then the smallest column index.
 * 
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a 
 * two-dimensional array and displays the location of the 
 * largest element in the array.
 * 
 * Sample Run
 * Enter the number of rows and columns of the array: 3 4
 * Enter the array:
 * 23.5 35 2 10
 * 4.5 3 45 3.5
