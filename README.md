## Overview

This repository showcases the work Iâ€™ve done from the start of my university journey to the present. Here, you'll find projects written in Java, C++, SQL. The aim is to document my learning progress and to provide a resource for anyone interested in my work or learning from my code.

## Languages, Technologies, and Tools

### Current Languages Taught at UT

- **Java**: Projects and assignments demonstrating object-oriented programming and core concepts.
- **C++**: Implementations of algorithms, data structures, and system-level programming exercises.
- **SQL**: Database queries, schema design, and complex queries to handle relational databases.

### Tools/Software Used
- Eclipse
- Microsoft Visual Studio
- Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- SQL Server Management Studio

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/Introduction to Computer Science & Engineering**: Beginner Java projects and assignments from my first semester at UT.
- **/Object-Oriented Programming**: Projects demonstrating object-oriented principles and design patterns.
- **/Linear Data Structures**: Assignments and projects focused on linear data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **/Non-Linear Data Structures**: Projects involving trees, graphs, and other non-linear data structures.
- **/Database Management Systems**: SQL projects involving database queries, schema design, and management.
